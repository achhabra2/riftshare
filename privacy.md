RiftShare does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. When you transfer files on the local network, traffic should stay on the local network after negotiating the connection. When transferring files through the internet, a tcp relay server is used if a direct connection cannot be established. The tcp relay does not have access to any of the transferred data as it is encrypted. 

In order to facilitate the file transfers (discoverability and private key exchange), a connection to the magic wormhole servers is necessary. Please read more about this process [here](https://magic-wormhole.readthedocs.io/en/latest/file-transfer-protocol.html).
